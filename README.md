# What is Python?

> Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively

[python.org](https://www.python.org/)

# TL;DR;

```bash
$ docker run -it --name python bitnami/python
```

## Docker Compose

```bash
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb/master/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up -d
```

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DTC)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# How to deploy Python in Kubernetes?

You can find an example for testing in the file `test.yaml`. To launch this sample file run:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f test.yaml
```

> NOTE: If you are pulling from a private containers registry, replace the image name with the full URL to the docker image. E.g.
>
> - image: 'your-registry/image-name:your-version'

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

> NOTE: Debian 8 images have been deprecated in favor of Debian 9 images. Bitnami will not longer publish new Docker images based on Debian 8.

# What are `prod` tagged containers for?

Containers tagged `prod` are production containers based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb). They contain the minimal dependencies required by an application to work.

They don't include development dependencies, so they are commonly used in multi-stage builds as the target image. Application code and dependencies should be copied from a different container.

The resultant containers only contain the necessary pieces of software to run the application. Therefore, they are smaller and safer.

Learn how to use multi-stage builds to build your production application container in the [example](/example) directory

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Python Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/python).

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/python:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/python/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/python:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```bash
$ docker build -t bitnami/python https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-python.git
```

# Entering the REPL

By default, running this image will drop you into the Python REPL, where you can interactively test and try things out in Python.

```bash
$ docker run -it --name python bitnami/python
```

# Configuration

## Running your Python script

The default work directory for the Python image is `/app`. You can mount a folder from your host here that includes your Python script, and run it normally using the `python` command.

```bash
$ docker run -it --name python -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/python \
  python script.py
```

## Running a Python app with package dependencies

If your Python app has a `requirements.txt` defining your app's dependencies, you can install the dependencies before running your app.

```bash
$ docker run --rm -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/python pip install -r requirements.txt
$ docker run -it --name python -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/python python script.py
```

or using Docker Compose:

```
python:
  image: bitnami/python:latest
  command: "sh -c 'pip install -r requirements.txt && python script.py'"
  volumes:
    - .:/app
```

# Maintenance

## Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of Python, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

### Step 1: Get the updated image

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/python:latest
```

or if you're using Docker Compose, update the value of the image property to `bitnami/python:latest`.

### Step 2: Remove the currently running container

```bash
$ docker rm -v python
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose rm -v python
```

### Step 3: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image.

```bash
$ docker run --name python bitnami/python:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose up python
```
